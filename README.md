## What Is This Repository?

This isn’t just a collection of notebooks.

It’s a **complete learning journey** — from implementing algorithms by hand to building production-ready ML pipelines — developed over the course of an intensive internship.

Every folder tells a chapter of that story: understanding *why* an algorithm works before trusting a library to do it. Writing clean pipelines. Tuning models properly. Building real projects that solve real problems — from predicting disease to segmenting customers to flagging medical anomalies.

## Featured Projects

###  [SmartCart Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/mehranmushtaq/ml-scikit-scratch/tree/main/Projects/customer-segmentation-smartcart)  

> **Domain:** Retail  ·  **Type:** Unsupervised Learning  ·  **Dataset:** 2,240 customers × 22 features

**The Problem:** SmartCart had thousands of customers but was treating them all the same — one message, one offer, one strategy. The goal was to discover natural groupings in the customer base so that marketing, product, and retention teams could act with precision.

**The Challenge:** No labels, no ground truth. The model had to find structure in raw behavioral and demographic data entirely on its own, and the number of segments wasn’t known upfront.

**Approach & Key Decisions:**

- **Missing values:** 24 records had missing `Income` — imputed using the **median** rather than the mean to avoid distortion from high-earner outliers
- **Feature engineering:** Raw columns were transformed into richer signals — `Age` (from birth year), `Customer_Tenure_Days` (loyalty duration), `Total_Spending` (sum of all category spend), `Total_Children`, and simplified `Education` and `Living_With` groups
- **Outlier removal:** Customers aged 90+ and income above $600k were dropped, reducing the dataset from 2,240 → 2,236 without losing signal
- **Encoding & scaling:** `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features, `StandardScaler` across all — both done inside a clean pipeline to prevent leakage
- **Dimensionality reduction:** PCA reduced the encoded feature space to **4 principal components** (~55% variance explained: 23.2%, 11.4%, 10.4%, 9.9%) — essential for meaningful distance-based clustering
- **K selection:** Used both the **Elbow Method (WCSS)** and **Silhouette Score** in a combined plot — both converged on **k = 4**
- **Final model:** Agglomerative Clustering with Ward linkage was selected over K-Means for its deterministic results and tighter, more balanced cluster boundaries

**Features Used:** `Income`, `Recency`, `NumDealsPurchases`, `NumWebPurchases`, `NumCatalogPurchases`, `NumStorePurchases`, `NumWebVisitsMonth`, `Complain`, `Response`, `Age`, `Customer_Tenure_Days`, `Total_Spending`, `Total_Children`, `Education` (encoded), `Living_With` (encoded)

**Results — Discovered Customer Segments:**

|Cluster|Avg Income|Avg Spending|Avg Age|Avg Children|Profile                          |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|------------|---------------------------------|
|0      |~$42,706  |~$327       |~56 yrs|1.23        |Budget-conscious, larger families|
|1      |~$66,279  |~$1,055     |~59 yrs|0.62        |Affluent loyalists, catalog-heavy|
|2      |~$35,326  |~$110       |~55 yrs|1.25        |Low-income, high web visits      |
|3      |~$74,727  |~$1,271     |~59 yrs|~0.37       |Premium spenders, fewest children|

**Business Impact:**

|Segment                            |Recommended Strategy                                                        |

### [Disease Prediction Pipeline](https://github.com/mehranmushtaq/ml-scikit-scratch/tree/main/Projects/disease_prediction_pipeline)

> **Domain:** Healthcare  ·  **Type:** Supervised Classification  ·  **Dataset:** 9,800 patients (NovaGen Research Labs)

**The Problem:** NovaGen Research Labs needed a reliable automated system to classify patients as healthy or at risk based on clinical features — to streamline participant selection for clinical trials and reduce manual screening time.

**The Challenge:** Healthcare data demands high recall — missing a sick patient is far more costly than a false alarm. A single model risked being too sensitive to noise. The solution required an ensemble that stayed robust across diverse patient profiles.

**Approach & Key Decisions:**

- **Pipeline-first design:** The entire workflow — imputation, encoding, scaling, and modeling — was encapsulated inside a single `sklearn.Pipeline` to guarantee zero data leakage between train and test sets
- **Ensemble strategy:** A **hard-voting classifier** combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes — each contributing a vote, with the majority deciding the final prediction. This reduces the variance of any single model’s weaknesses
- **Stratified K-Fold CV:** Used stratified splits throughout to ensure class proportions were preserved across every fold, critical for a medical dataset
- **Evaluation focus:** Optimized for **recall** alongside accuracy — in clinical settings, false negatives are the higher-risk failure mode

**Results:**

|Metric             |Score                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
|Accuracy           |**94.89%**                         |
|CV Recall          |**95.46%**                         |
|Validation Strategy|Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation |
|Model              |Hard-Voting Ensemble (LR + RF + NB)|

**Real-World Use Case:** Automated pre-screening of 9,800 patient records for clinical trial eligibility — reducing manual review workload by flagging candidates with 95%+ recall.

**Tech:** `pandas`, `sklearn` (Pipeline, VotingClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB, StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score)

### [E-Commerce Purchase Prediction](https://github.com/mehranmushtaq/ml-scikit-scratch/tree/main/Projects/ecommerce-purchase-prediction)

> **Domain:** Retail  ·  **Type:** Supervised Classification  ·  **Dataset:** 12,330 browsing sessions (ShopSmart)

**The Problem:** ShopSmart had 12,330 recorded browsing sessions but only ~15% ended in a purchase. The marketing team needed a model to identify which visitors were likely to convert — so they could target interventions at the right moment.

**The Challenge:** An extreme **85/15 class imbalance** meant that a naïve model could score 85% accuracy by predicting “no purchase” every time — completely useless in practice. The real target was maximising F1-Score, not accuracy.

**Approach & Key Decisions:**

- **Class imbalance handling:** Used `class_weight='balanced'` in the Decision Tree — this automatically adjusts sample weights inversely proportional to class frequency, forcing the model to pay attention to the minority (purchase) class
- **Depth pruning:** `max_depth` tuning via GridSearchCV to prevent overfitting on the majority class and improve generalisation to purchase patterns
- **Feature set:** Session-level behavioral signals — page views, visit duration, bounce rate, exit rate, special day proximity, month, visitor type, and browser/region/OS metadata
- **Evaluation:** Prioritised **F1-Score** as the primary metric — the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which penalises models that sacrifice one for the other

**Results:**

|Metric         |Score                               |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
|F1-Score       |**0.6485**                          |
|Benchmark F1   |0.55                                |
|Improvement    |**+18% above benchmark**            |
|Class Imbalance|85% non-purchase / 15% purchase     |
|Validation     |Train/test split with stratification|

**Real-World Use Case:** Flag high-intent sessions in real time — trigger discount popups, live chat, or cart reminders for users the model identifies as likely converters.

**Tech:** `pandas`, `sklearn` (DecisionTreeClassifier, GridSearchCV, classification_report, train_test_split), `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### [CreditWise Loan Approval System](https://github.com/mehranmushtaq/ml-scikit-scratch/tree/main/Projects/CreditWise%20Loan%20System)

> **Domain:** Finance  ·  **Type:** Supervised Classification  ·  **Deliverable:** Notebook + Production `.py` script

**The Problem:** Manual loan approval is slow, inconsistent, and prone to bias. CreditWise needed an automated classification system that could assess applicant risk from financial and demographic data — consistently, at scale.

**The Challenge:** Financial data is messy — mixed types, missing values, skewed distributions, and categorical variables that need careful encoding. The pipeline had to handle all of this cleanly before any model could be trained.

**Approach & Key Decisions:**

- **Feature engineering:** Derived new risk signals from raw inputs — debt-to-income proxies, employment stability indicators, and interaction terms between credit history and income band
- **Preprocessing pipeline:** `ColumnTransformer` applied different strategies to numerical (imputation + scaling) and categorical (encoding) features simultaneously — keeping the workflow clean and reproducible
- **Model selection:** Multiple classifiers evaluated — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting — with `GridSearchCV` used to tune the best-performing model
- **Production delivery:** The final model was exported as a standalone `.py` script alongside the notebook, making it directly deployable to a backend service or batch scoring system

**Highlights:**

|Aspect        |Detail                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Input features|Income, loan amount, credit history, employment, dependents, property area|
|Preprocessing |Median imputation, OneHot encoding, StandardScaler                        |
|Evaluation    |Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix                         |
|Deliverable   |Notebook (exploration) + `.py` script (production-ready)                  |

**Real-World Use Case:** Automated loan pre-screening — score thousands of applications in seconds, surface high-risk rejections and fast-track low-risk approvals.

**Tech:** `pandas`, `sklearn` (Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, GridSearchCV, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, LogisticRegression), `matplotlib`

### [Thyroid Outlier Detection](https://github.com/mehranmushtaq/ml-scikit-scratch/tree/main/Projects/thyroid_outlier_detection)

> **Domain:** Healthcare  ·  **Type:** Unsupervised Anomaly Detection  ·  **Dataset:** 1,000 patient lab records

**The Problem:** In a dataset of 1,000 thyroid hormone lab results, a small number of patients had profiles that were clinically abnormal — but there were no labels indicating which ones. The system had to find anomalies without any ground truth.

**The Challenge:** Unsupervised anomaly detection is difficult to evaluate — there’s no label to train on, and different methods can disagree on what counts as “abnormal.” Combining multiple detectors and validating against clinical thresholds was essential.

**Approach & Key Decisions:**

- **Dual-detector approach:** Both **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** were applied independently — Isolation Forest excels at global anomalies (extreme values), while LOF catches local outliers (unusual relative to nearby points). Agreement between both detectors increased confidence in flagged cases
- **No labels required:** The system learns the “normal” distribution from the data itself — any patient whose profile deviates significantly from the learned structure is flagged
- **Feature set:** Thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4, TSH) and related clinical markers — standardised before detection to prevent scale bias
- **Threshold tuning:** Contamination parameter tuned to reflect clinical expectations of outlier prevalence in the patient population
- **Evaluation:** Since no ground truth labels existed, results were validated by checking flagged patients against known clinical reference ranges for hypo/hyperthyroid conditions

**Results:**

|Metric         |Score                    |
|---------------|-------------------------|
|Precision@K    |**89%**                  |
|Detectors Used |Isolation Forest + LOF   |
|Dataset        |1,000 patient lab records|
|Labels Required|None (fully unsupervised)|

**Real-World Use Case:** Automated lab result triage — flag patients for clinician review before they present with symptoms, enabling earlier intervention for thyroid disorders.

**Tech:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn` (IsolationForest, LocalOutlierFactor, StandardScaler), `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
